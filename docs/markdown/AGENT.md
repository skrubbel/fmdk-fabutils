# Background

We are planning an introduction to Python notebooks (not Spark) in Microsoft Fabric. The audience is a team of Business Intelligence Consultants who are comfortable with working on the platform and also with Spark Data Engineering.

We should show demos and presentations that highlights the difference between Python notebooks and Spark/PySpark notebooks and presents arguments for scenarios where Python notebooks would be a good fit, and sometimes superior to Spark, in solutions.
